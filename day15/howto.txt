this demo requires  BOSS basic compiler for commodore 64 to run at decent speed
it is adapted from the boss demo bundled with the product (back in 1988)

first need to compile to normal prg using
petcat -w2 -o DEMO2.PRG -- <text source file
this will also convert embedded petschii !

resulting can be loaded in vice or CD64 using
LOAD"DEMO2.PRG",8
but very very slow

compiling to ASM using BOSS result in significant speed up !
cross compiler for windows available at:
https://csdb.dk/release/?id=103888
(original was on C64 but easier from windows)
bbcompiler.exe DEMO2.PRG +DEMO2.PRG
then load in binary
LOAD"+DEMO2.PRG",8,1
(+ symbol is convention to mark compiled basic)

after load, type
RUN
and then 2 (this is the second demo, code was not cleaned)
